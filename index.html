            <p>“We push each other to be the best. It’s not 
                uncommon for one of us to say ‘this needs 
                to be better, back to the drawing board’” 
                - Bryan Teddy, lead vocalist of The Bees 
                Knees</p>
            <p>The Bees Knees</p>
            <p>The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating 
                from San Francisco, California. The band 
                consists of lead vocalist Bryan Teddy, guitarist 
                Mack Tolkens, guitarist Andrew Green, bassist 
                Kent Zulkee and drummer Freddie Fischer. The 
                band achieved its first commercial success as 
                an unsigned act, drawing attention from 
                manager Cam Adams. Having worked with 
                other popular acts (The Elephant In The Room, 
                One Trick Pony, The Cat’s Meow), Adams was 
                confident the band could succeed even further, 
                pushing them to sign with Magenta Records.</p>

            <p>From there, the band has soared, gaining 
                international recognition and ranking in the 
                top 10 on the Poster Charts. New fans 
                immediately fell in love with the band’s original 
                and organic attitude, solidifying their place as 
                one of the hottest and fastest up and coming 
                acts of this century. Fans affectionately refer to 
                themselves as “The Hive” and are drawn to 
                their candid and authentic performances on 
                stage. Looking forward to touring in the future, 
                The Bees Knees are currently recording their 
                second studio album, looking to be released in 
                late 2021.</p>
